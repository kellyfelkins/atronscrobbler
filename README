Atronscrobbler attempts to provide audioscrobbler plugin
functionality for Voyetra Turtle Beach Audiotron users. To learn more
about audioscrobbler, visit http://www.audioscrobbler.com/. To learn
more about the audiotron, visit 
http://www.turtlebeach.com/site/products/audiotron/producthome.asp.

Atronscrobbler works by polling the configured audiotron and reporting
play activity to audioscrobbler.

Atronscrobbler is a perl script. It has been tested with perl 5.8.3 on
Debian linux (version 'woody', I think) and Windows XP/cygwin version circa 2/feb/05.
It will likely run on activestate perl on windows systems. 

Required perl modules:

	POSIX qw(strftime);
	LWP::UserAgent;
	Digest::MD5 qw(md5_hex);


CONFIGURATION

Atronscrobbler requires some basic configuration information. That 
information is loaded from 2 possible configuration files.
It looks first for a ~/.atronscrobbler. If that is not found it 
looks for /etc/atronscrobbler. If that is not
found it displays a message about configuration and exits.

INSTALLATION

Atronscrobbler is a simple perl script and will run anywhere you run
perl scripts. I run it out of ~/bin.

Create a configuration file either in your home directory or in /etc

	~/.atronscrobbler

or

	/etc/atronscrobbler

You can use the provided example configuration file as a template,
also listed below:

~/.atronscrobbler or /etc/atronscrobbler
